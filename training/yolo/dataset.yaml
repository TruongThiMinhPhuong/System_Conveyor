# YOLOv8 Fruit Detection Dataset Configuration

# Dataset paths (adjust these paths to your actual dataset)
path: ./datasets/fruit_detection  # Root directory
train: images/train  # Train images (relative to 'path')
val: images/val      # Validation images (relative to 'path')
test: images/test    # Test images (optional)

# Number of classes
nc: 3

# Class names
# Modify this list based on the fruits you want to detect
names:
  0: apple
  1: orange
  2: banana

# Additional notes:
# - Each image should have a corresponding .txt label file
# - Label format: <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
# - All coordinates are normalized to [0, 1]
# - Example label: 0 0.5 0.5 0.3 0.4
#   (apple at center, 30% width, 40% height)
